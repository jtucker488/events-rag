AI-powered web app that helps users find music events in NYC. Event data is pulled from the Ticketmaster API, embedded using vector representations, and stored in Pinecone for efficient retrieval. When users ask a question, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system fetches relevant events, allowing AI to generate personalized responses. Built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
